<h1>Hello World!</h1>
The event will be held for two full days in the Boston area in the non-tourist season, likely Feb 9-10, 2016
(we will poll participants for precise dates). The likely venue (Hampton Crosstown Center Boston) was chosen
per these criteria: (a) low cost (we rejected using a meeting room at Broad due to pricier local lodging),
(b) accessible by a free airport shuttle, (c) meeting room with sufficient capacity, strong WiFi, and open
all hours.<br>
We will work hard to assist travel expenses for those who could not otherwise attend; please contact us.
We also welcome remote participants who, for physical or family reasons, are unable to travel.
We will obtain grants to cover food and the hacking room. Each laboratory should plan to finance their
own travel and lodging. Although attendance is otherwise limited to 1 slot per lab, we can offer an additional
spot to any lab sending someone from an underrepresented group (we leave it to your own judgment how this
is defined) and will do our best to obtain funding for at least some of the pre-approved travel expenses
for members of these groups (please contact us).</p>
